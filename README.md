# Pyromania-Debunk & Scammer tactics revealed
Pyromania Debunk - Edited frames reveal that the blast effect from RegicideAnon's satellite video (Frame 1313) was inserted into a manipulated version of Pyromania’s shockwave.

Scammers have employed increasingly sophisticated tactics, inserting RegicideAnon satellite video frames (notably Frame 1313) into the Pyromania shockwave effect to create convincing fakes. Manipulated Pyromania frames—first appearing in the Web Archive as early as 2021—are recycled and repurposed in subsequent exhibits, including Waverider and Bakertuts.

### Original Pyromania version found 2014 and pre 2014 do not show any fabrications.

### Every serious investigation into scammer tactics uncovers the same playbook:

```
1. Fabricate evidence and subtly insert it into existing artifacts to falsely suggest the asset predates 2014.
2. Launch disinformation campaigns using VFX videos, mockery, and coordinated attacks.
3. Respond to scrutiny with harassment and doxing.
4. When challenged, provide flawed technical assessments to dismiss legitimate concerns.
5. Block independent investigation of the planted artifacts, relying on "trust me bro" appeals instead of transparency.
6. This report details one such case: The Pyromania debunk.
7. Use this as a guide to recognize scammer patterns, understand their methods, and draw your own conclusions.

### Fabricated 2021 Pond5 & Waverider3000 uploads sequence is a **textbook case of frame insertion manipulation:**

#### Frame 1:
You can see non-natural, clustered dots above the main shockwave—these match features from the RegicideAnon video, not the original shockwave propagation.

#### Frame 2:
Those dots remain, and the shockwave edge pattern persists. This is inconsistent with genuine explosive or wave propagation, where the shock front and all secondary effects must change frame to frame as energy dissipates or interacts with the medium.

#### Frame 3:
Despite further evolution, artifacts (dots, internal ring segmentation, persistent local noise) remain almost locked, rather than evolving smoothly.

### Key forensic observation:
Shockwave propagation—especially in controlled media (fluid, smoke, fire)—is never static or repeated between frames. Each frame should show progressive, radial movement and noise evolution. Here, critical internal structures (dots, ring discontinuities) are artificially “locked in,” proof that external content (from RegicideAnon) was overlaid onto a genuine effect and recycled in multiple sequential frames. This is only possible by compositing or direct frame insertion, and impossible in any natural shockwave scenario, which is evident from the natural wave progrssion of 2009 Pyromania version.
